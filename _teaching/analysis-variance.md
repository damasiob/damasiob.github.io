Objectives
======
* To develop skills on analysis of experiments using R;
* To design and conduct an experiment that exhibits both a treatment design and randomization design that allow for the testing of differences between the levels of a single or multiple treatment of interest;
* To specify an appropriate statistical model for observations resulting from a designed experiment;
* To conduct and correctly interpret statistical hypothesis tests for the overall effect of a treatment and for the effects of contrasts;
* To employ methods for multiple comparisons to control the experiment error rate when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted;
* To examine model assumptions using residual plots and a description of the experiment.

Syllabus
======
* Principles of Experimental Design and Simple Comparative Experiments
* Experiments with a Single Factor: The Analysis of Variance
* Blocking
* Factorial Design
