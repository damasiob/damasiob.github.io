I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Lisbon in 2019.  I hold an M.Sc. in Econometrics and a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Lisbon. My research is primarily driven toward econometrics, time-series, causal inference, and data science. I also complementarily invest in themes related to policy evaluation, scientometrics, and applied economics in general. My work has been published in several leading journals, such as PLoS ONE, Habitat International, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Statistics and Probability Letters, Research Evaluation, Telecommunications Policy, among others.  Additionally, I have taught for the past ten years and am currently a lecturer of statistics and econometrics at NOVA IMS (Nova University of Lisbon). I serve as a statistical consultant and trainer for numerous private and public organizations, including the OECD, European Commission, European Court of Auditors, and various other institutions, including Ministries, National Statistical Authorities, Regulators and Central Banks (all from eight countries).
