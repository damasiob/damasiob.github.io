I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics, a Master in Econometrics and a Degree in Economics by the University of Lisbon. My research interests are nonlinear econometrics, multivariate Markov chains, stochastic processes, financial econometrics, nonlinear time-series, applied economics, and the statistical packages R and Stata. Several of my works have been published in journals, such as Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Statistics and Probability Letters, Applied Economics Letters, Empirica. Additionally, I also lecture statistics and econometrics courses at NOVA IMS (Information Management School, Nova University of Lisbon) and ISEG (Lisbon School of Economics and Management, University of Lisbon). Currently, I am also serving as a statistical consultant and trainer for numerous private and public organisations including OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), European Comission, European Court of Auditors, Ministries, Central Banks, Bureau of Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, among others.
